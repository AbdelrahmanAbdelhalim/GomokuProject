# Coursework 1 for CSC325 course at Swansea University (2021):

This coursework involves building an AI agent that can play the Gomoku Game. This Agent will compete against other agents that were produced by students in a tournament. The coursework deadline is 5/3/2021.

## Progress So Far:
* Initial Commit for the helper files produced by lecturer
* Wrote down the basic functions for minmax algorithm in Player/player.py
* Agent now is able to play on a 3x3 board (tic-tac-toe)
* There is a bug with the algorithm since the agent loses to the random agent in some occasions (working on a fix)


## Work that needs to be done:
* Fixing the minmax algorithm
* Writing algorithm for depth cut off and pruning
* Further optimization and strategy

## Notes:
* The coursework will be submitted as soon as the agent is able to play games on the full 11x11 board
* Further optimization will be done and submitted afterwards
